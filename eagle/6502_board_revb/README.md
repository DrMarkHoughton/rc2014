<b>6502 CPU Board for the RC2014 RevB</b>
<p>
This is the RevB version of the board.
<p>
New:
<br>
- Optional jumper to connect R/W to pin 39 of the bus
<br>
- A14 can be inverted. Inverting A14 will allow you to use the RC2014 64KB RAM board. Configure that board for 48KB of RAM, starting from 4000h. The inverted A14 will map the 48KB to 0-BFFFh in the 6502 address space, giving you a whopping 48KB of RAM!
<br>
- NMI can be accessed with a test pin/point
<br>
- You can use a 1/2 size oscillator.
<p>
Otherwise this board works the same as the original version.
