<b>ROM Images for RC2014 6502 Monitor/Debugger</b>
<p>
The ROM images here are for you to burn into ROM, EPROM, EEPROM devices.
<p>
However, the actual executable code is at the top of ROM. For example, the latest version holds the Monitor/Debugger in the top 2KB of the 32KB image.
<p>
In order to support the different sizes of ROM devices that you may be using, I have pre-built 8KB, 16KB and 32KB images for each UART that is supported: 16C550, 6850 and RRUART (the Real Retro UART Board).
